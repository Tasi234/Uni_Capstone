Small web app created for Witron Logistics, completed as apart of my capstone unit for the Bachelor of Information Technology at SCU by a group of 4 of us near-graduates.  
App takes data from users and collates it into a HTML-formatted email sent out to the chosen recipents as its primary feature, along with a Incident Report form and contact list.   
Technologies used: Angular framework, NodeJS API, Java/Typescript, HTML/CSS.  
Here is a short video demonstrating the features of the build:
